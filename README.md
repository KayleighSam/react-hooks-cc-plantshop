#### The app is my Plantsy web code challenge
#### **By Samson Mwaura Wanjiru**
## Description
The application includes a  landing page showing a list of plant records with descriptions such as name, price, and status, i.e., whether it is available or sold.
Users have a section to add new plants, with information such as plant name, image, and price. When they add a plant, the record is added to the catalog.
A user can also search for a specific record using keywords in the search section. Finally, a user can be able to check the plant record status from Available to sold out.
